This Spreadsheet is made using JavaScript.
You can use JS Spreadsheet CDN to built this type of program. However, it's my college project and we were not allowed to use CDN link so I did code for it.

Steps how to use:
Step 1: Download this repo to your local system
Step 2: Run index.html file into your chrome browser
Step 3: Select any cell
Step 4: To add value into selected cell, Enter any digit to the given input box and press Enter
Step 5: To clear Spreadsheet at once, click on the clear button

You can also perform airthmatic operation.

To perform it, add any formula into the input box and press enter i.e =A1+B1
